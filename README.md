Hello this is the readme for Diamond in the Rough! 
This mod will ultimately add 7 new NPCs, 4 pet NPCs and a new plot-line to East Scarp. 
Please note this mod is in early alpha most content is unfinished.

Requires:
*East Scarp - https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787
*MEEP - https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14493

This mod is built for only 1.6. Do not install if you're running SDV 1.5.6.

Note: If you currently have Lurking in the Dark installed, you can remove it as this mod adds a revamped Sen. 
(LitD is also designed to turn itself off so there will be no loading issues if you do leave it in.)
