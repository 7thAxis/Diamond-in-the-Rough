6H P1 (Of probably 3)

[Trace, Sen, Krobus, Eve and Waffle are hanging out in Sen's room. Farmer enters. Initiate this via a letter from Trace.]

Eve: You have an... interesting system of organization, Sen.

Trace: Leave him alone, your house is hardly any tidier.

Sen: What are you talking about? My space is quite tidy if I do say so myself.

Krobus: [notices the farmer] Oh, everyone... We have a visitor.

Sen: Oh, @, you came! Come in, come in!

[farmer walks in]

Trace: [jumps in surprise] O-oh! Hey, @. You actually showed up.

Eve: Welcome to the goober gathering, farmer. I was also invited, much to my dismay.

Sen: ...Trace, I thought you said she was a nice person?

Trace: I told you she was mostly harmless, there's a difference.

Eve: Oh my gosh - I'm kidding! [steps forward] Whatever, glad you're here, @. Trace really wanted you to come.

Trace: Tch! [turns to the side] @ seems cool is all. No need to put emphasis on it.

Eve: Ignore 'em, they're just shy.

[group heads around the scrungly table]

Krobus: So... what are our plans for 'hanging out'?

Trace: I, uh, didn't really plan that far ahead to be honest.

Sen: Not to worry! I have lots of things to do around here. Does anyone want to crochet? [gets up and checks his shelf] Oh dear... I only have one set of hooks...?

Farmer:
-> Well if we have no plans, how about we just chat?
Trace: That sounds good to me. I'll pick up some crochet hooks for next time. Get your tail back over here Sen!
Sen: Hmm. But I could have SWORN I had at least one more set... Aha! Wait no, those are 'chop sticks', they didn't work.
Trace: Seeeeeeeeeeen.
Sen: Coming, coming!

-> (Offer to help Sen look)
Sen: Ahh. No need, seems like I've really only got one pair.
Trace: Well dang, I'll pick up some crochet hooks for next time.
Krobus: Hm... maybe we can chat instead? I would... like to get to know you all a little better.
Eve: I wouldn't mind that. You seem like a cool little guy, Krobus.
Krobus: A... cool little guy?

[Sen hurries back over to his seat]
