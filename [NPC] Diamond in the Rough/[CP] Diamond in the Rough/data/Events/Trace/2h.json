/*Trace: [steps into yard] Uhg... What a day. I just want to crawl into my bed and...

Sen: [caught in trash] ...!

Trace: Wh-wh-?!? What the?! Jeremy we've got a trash burglar!

Jeremy: [sits there]

Sen: EEK! [runs back and forth, then realizes he's stuck and backs into the shadows] B-back off! I-f you get any closer, I-I'll- I'll um- 

Trace: What'll ya do? You're in my yard, trash thief! I'll ask you one more time before I sick the snail on ya.

Jeremy: ? [slides past the commotion and goes inside]

Trace: [pauses] Uh. Who are you, and what are you doing in my trash?

Sen: ... [shakes] ...I-I'm. [forces confidence] My name is Sen! [steps out into the light] I was looking for garbage treasure!

Trace: You- [takes a step back] You're...

Sen: Scary? Terrifying? Menacing? [steps forward] A freak of nature?

Trace: A Shadow? [Note: Knows about Shadows from Eve and the Monster Compendium. Their old partner read the book to them.]

Sen: Um. You meant to say scary, terrifying, menacing and a freak of nature, right?

Trace: I don't think those words came outta my mouth, no. [steps forward]

Sen: [bounces back] Watch it! I got claws and I know how to use 'em!

Trace: Okay Sen, you're a riot. Did you find anything exciting in my trash?

Sen: ...??? Are you not absolutely quaking in your boots right now?

Trace: I'm wearing sandals.

Sen: [pauses] ...No. Your trash yielded no particularly interesting finds. //I want to randomize this but it ruins the punchline's vibe.

Krobus: [approaches from the north] Sen! You won't believe what I just found in "Tori's" trash--Eek! [Krobus jumps backwards upon seeing Trace]

Trace: Hey there - Wait! Don't be afraid of me! The name's Trace, what's yours?

Krobus: H-huh...? It's... [pauses cautiously] My name is Krobus.

Sen: [walks over to Krobus] Trace, was it? You really don't seem too weirded out by a pair of cryptids standing in your yard...

Trace: Heh. I used to travel a lot. I've met faaar stranger folks, trust me. [looks back and forth] ...Uh, would you two like to come inside?

Sen: You're inviting us inside?

Krobus: [turns to Sen, mutters something inaudible]

Sen: Ahh. Good point...

Krobus: Th-thank you for your hospitality, but we will have to decline your offer.

Trace: Oh, no, that's alright. I get it. But hey, my door's always open. Feel free to stop by! I'd love to chat.
[Note: Expression changes based on if you talked to them or not in 0h. $s if no, $h if yes. Internalizes ppl avoiding them.]

[Sen turns to Krobus, then back to Trace cheerfully. Krobus is a bit cautious and protective of his buddy. Both leave.] 
[Trace stands around for a moment lost in thought, then goes inside.]

//P2
[Short textless event a day or so later showing Sen (optimistic) and Krobus (cautious) outside Trace's house. Door knock. Trace comes out with :D face and invites them inside. Needed for pacing. Implies they start talking]*/
