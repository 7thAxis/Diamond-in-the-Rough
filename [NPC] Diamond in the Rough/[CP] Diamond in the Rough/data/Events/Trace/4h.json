/*[Trace, Krobus and Sen are outside by Eve's trash can. Farmer walks by and observes from a distance]

Sen: Drats! There's nothing in here!

Trace: Shocker, it's usually full of old explosives.

Krobus: Do you... go through your friend's trash often?

[Eve exits her house, no one notices, pauses and taps her foot]

Sen: Is that weird? I do that to @'s bin all the time. //High heart
Sen: Hm? Do humans not usually go through each other's bins? //Low heart

Trace: Nah, I've just seen Eve chuck stuff that's expired or whatever.

Krobus: Explosives... expire?

Trace: Ey. Don't ask me, I've got no idea how she makes 'em. Whatever, this can's a bust. Let's move.

Sen: [text over head] Roger that!

[the group move down, confronted by Eve]

Sen: AH!
Krobus: Eek!

[both step back]

Trace: [turns to them] Don't worry, y'all got nothing to fear from her. Trust me.

Eve: ...Trace.

Trace: Ahem, I on the other hand.

Eve: I'm tryin' to sleep. Why is there a parade in my back yard?

[Trace turns around, strikes a stupid pose]

Trace: Worry not! This parade is marching on!

[Krobus is nervous, Sen puts his trust in Trace and approaches]

Sen: Y-Yup, we'll be right out of your way! No harm meant!

Krobus: [encouraged by Sen's enthusiasm, steps forward] Yes, we're very sorry for the d-disturbance.

Eve: [shocked when she sees Sen] ...! [pause] [turns back towards her house] What a gaggle of weirdos. Just get off my lawn, will ya? 

Trace: [notices the odd reaction, but ignores it] Yes ma'am!

[All 3 turn and watch as Eve goes back inside]

Sen: She seems... a tad high strung.

Trace: Always, but she's harmless. Mostly.

Krobus: It's strange. She hardly reacted to us... Does she also know of Shadowfolk?

Trace: Yuppidoodles. I can't say much, though. It ain't my place. But like I said, you can trust her. [turns back towards Eve's door] Anyway, let's not loiter. You don't want to see her when she's actually mad.

[The group begins walking to the left, where they encounter the farmer]

Trace: Aw jeez, we're getting caught by everyone tonight, huh? (ONLY IF KROBUS IS NOT MET) Don't worry, Krob. This is another safe one.

Sen: Oh, @! Fancy meeting you here. Wanna hang out with us?
