/*[Trace is on the ES beach. A seagull lands next to them.]

Trace: Hey there little dude. Want some bagel?

[Trace tears a piece off. Gull pecks at the ground, eats it and caws.. Pause. Another gull appears.]

Trace: Oh uh, hey buddy! You want some too?

[Trace tears off another piece. Repeat. Another gull appears]

Trace: Uh... I'm almost out of bagel but-

[Another gull appears, and another]

Trace: Hey look buddies I'm sorry. I don't have enough to go around-

[The gulls approach, cawing.]

"Now now now. Let's not get feisty-"

[Gulls flap into air]

Trace: ...Uh oh.

[Gulls start swooping at Trace]

Trace: Eeeekk...! YOBA WHY?!

[Trace makes a run for it, falling flat on their face near the farmer]

[The farmer approaches the gulls, shooing them off. They then turn to offer Trace help up, but they get up themself.)

Trace: Uhg. Jeez not only did that happen, but someone SAW it. Ah well.

[Trace turns to face the farmer]

Trace: Thanks for saving me. Ya try to be nice to a gull one time, and this is how they repay ya...

Farmer: ...Are you alright? You kinda fell on your face.
>Oh what? Naw, I'm fine. Just got a little sand in my mouth. I'll most likely live to see another day. Pweh. Gritty.

Farmer: ...Do you get attacked by wild animals often?
>Well I wouldn't say it happens too often but- Pweh. Gritty. Sorry, sand in my mouth- I'd be lying if I said it ain't the first time.

[Trace giggles]

Trace: Anyway uh, you're @, right? Farmer on the other side of the Valley? If you've got a minute to stop and chat, I'd love to get to know my savior from the avian menace.

[FOOOORK]

Farmer: "Sure, I've got some time!"
Trace: Oh how exciting, I promise I'll only ask the most important questions. Such as... [Dramatic pause] ...Do you like pulp in your orange juice?

[Farmer pauses]

Trace: What, I promise it's an important question that will ensure we are able to get along! Don't raise an eyebrow at me!

[Show further interaction with emotes]

[Fade to black]

System: Well, do you like pulp in your orange juice?

>Yes, power to the pulp!
-- Apply like flag and CT
>Yes, but I'm not picky.
-- Apply neutral flag and CT
>No, the texture is disgusting.
-- Apply hate texture flag and CT
>No, I hate orange juice.
-- Apply hate OJ flag and CT

[Note to self: Save this response to a DT. Will use in epilogue.]

System: Trace will remember that.

[END]

Farmer: "Gotta go, sorry"
>Aww, alright. Well, I'll catch you around later I suppose... Careful on your way outta the Scarp, those gulls might still be out there looking for revenge.

[Add did not humor Trace nonsense CT, save to DT for epilogue.]

[Farmer walks off, fade to black with Trace waving]
