(Eve walks past Trace with Waffle and Pipo close behind)

Eve: ...grumble grumble grumble...

Trace: Might I inquire what you're grumbling about over there, madam Evening?

Eve: ... Oh goodie, another stray cat. Can I help you?

Trace: Tch. How cold! I'm hurt, m'lady. I'm simply checking on you.~

Eve: Okay okay, drop the fancy talk will ya? It doesn't fit you.

Trace: Pppftt. Alright fine. But no seriously, are you okay? Seems like you're in a bit of a mood.

Eve: Eh, I'm kinda irritated with humanity at the moment. I just got out from Jacob's and, apparently, this little guy here was dumped off and abandoned by their owner. 

(Pipo moment)

Trace: Whaaaat? Who'd ever want to throw a cutie with a face like that to the curb??

Eve: Right?! My thoughts exactly! Uhg, it grinds my gears that some people can be so heartless.

Trace: You got a plan for housing 'em?

Eve: Depends. Do you want a cat?

Trace: Sure! :D

Eve: ... I was kidding, are you serious?

Trace: Dead serious. Just look at that faaaace.

(Pipo moment)

Eve: I mean I was planning to keep them myself if it came down to it, but my place is pretty small. ...Are you sure you're prepared to take on a cat?

Trace: Tcchhh! You dare question my animal caretaking skills? I'll have you know that Jeremy is very well cared for!

Eve: Jeremy is a snail. Different caliber of difficulty.

Trace: That is not true! Snails like Jeremy require an environment with at least 75% retained humidity and a temperature maintained around 65-75 degrees fahrenheit, with a heater attached to the side so they don't bury themselves and overheat. They also need a nutrient rich substrate as well as a calcium supplement for optimal shell heal-

Eve: Point taken. The cat's yours.

Trace: Yay. I'll call them... Pipo...

Eve: ...You're gonna name them after the sound of their meow?

Trace: You named your dog after a breakfast item. I don't want to hear it.

Eve: Touche.

(Trace giggle sprite)

Trace: Well given this turn of events, it looks like I'll need some supplies. Mind making the journey to Marnie's with me?

Eve: Sure, you're gonna get lost if I don't come with you anyways.

Trace: Such cruelty. I have no idea how you ever came to that conclusion.

Eve: Can it, princess. Let's go.
